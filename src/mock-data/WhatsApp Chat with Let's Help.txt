23/07/17,- Dear members Mr. Amit Mehta (resident and owner of House No. 247, Ek roop Avenue, Majitha bypass, Majitha Road, Amritsar, (Mob. 9876526385) father of three daughters out of which two are twins, earns Rs.9000 only by working as besan (gram flour) salesman. His twins are 12 years and the third daughter is 5 yRs.One of the twins Ujjaini Mehta is deaf and dump but extremely beautiful child with a keen desire to study. A lot of money was spent on her treatment with no positive results. She cries and expresses her desire in her own unique style which obviously her parents understand. She was earlier studying in a special school where she has cleared her 2nd class but due to the money spent on the treatment of her grandfather who was a victim of bone cancer, the family is facing the monetary crisis. Unfortunately they couldn't save the old man inspite of all efforts. Since two other daughters are studying, Ujjaini also wants to study but the family can't afford the expenses. So the poor special child is sitting home vacant with the suppressed desire to study since last one year.She needs to be self sufficient economically too in future because of her condition. Let's Help wants to offer help to the family in the same context. Your very valuable permission is awaited. The case has been referred by our member Mr. Amit Kumar (9781052345). Thnx

01/08/17,- Dear members With reference to Ujjaini Mehta (deaf and dumb girl child) case, this is informed that 'Let's Help' had helped the family to open her bank account in SBI in which it will be depositing ₹ 1000 every month since the family has told that besides her monthly fee approximately ₹ 550, the auto rickshaw charges are also to be paid. Her parents will also contribute some amount for the same. They will show the receipt of monthly fee every month after paying it but will not be able to show any receipt of auto rickshaw bill since he does not provide any. So every month 'Let's Help' will deposit ₹ 1000 in Ujjaini's account. Pl note. Thnx Rs.300 Monika Bhalla.

03/09/17,- Rs.1000 deposited in Ujjani Mehta (9876526385) SBI account no. 37046001167 Shanghai News today sent an SOS - a third reminder that experts advise & recommend: Please don't send Good morning, good night, or festivals greetings such as pictures, movies. A lot of people reported that hackers designed the pictures, movies perfect for hiding phishing; when everybody forwards and sends those, they will go and steal personal information. If you would like to greet one another, type your own to protect yourself, as well as protecting friends! (Review 57 Eastern Financial reported consecutively 5 sets of invited victims, described the fraud process at 11:00), victims of some 200,000 people!!! (Very important). Reminder: make sure delete all early and late and exquisite designs, films of the new year's greetings (really really necessary to do so even though reluctantly) for self safety, and that of friends to avoid hackers phishing. Afraid that yours and mine personal data would be stolen. Losses, harm and damage result more than gains. So, from now on, all Good morning, afternoon, evening and highlights of new year's greeting, or pictures, movies - please delete all. Greet each other by typing own words or use completely self made picture, completely self produced film, video. Self creation is completely safe. Warning above for your reference. REQUEST YOU NOT TO SEND ANY GOOD MORNING GOOD NIGHT MESSAGES WITH PICTURES ESPECIALLY GIFs AS THEY CONTAIN EMBEDDED PROGRAMS WRITTEN TO BROADCAST YOUR DETAILS INCLUDING BANK AND CREDIT CARD DETAILS, CONTACTS, ETC.

Waiting for your green signal for the same. Thnx
19/11/17,- 👆👆👆 Above said Case referred by our members Mr. Sanjay seth ji and Mr. Rishi Jain ji.
19/11/17,- Dear members The above said case seems to b ingenuine to you bcoz the man in question doesn’t do any work n seems to b hale n healthy but Let’s Help’s perspective is that he used to belong to a royal family. His father was MLA and his mum was Principal in a govt. college. He started drinking alcohol since he was ten yrs old. His married life was not successful. He has no kids. From last 14 yrs he hadn’t bn working. He was not given any share in the property. No relative is bothered about him. Moreover he is having tumour on his feet too. Doctors say that he may develop cancer. So he is living a life of frustration. Above all if a person is lethargic n is not ready to work inspite of so called healthy body, it’s actually a big curse of God.

Dalip Chand (Resident of H.no 123/11, Gali Mati Wali, Churasti Atari Chowk, Near Ucha Shivala, Amritsar (mobile no. 9501355444) joint property of him and his brother, has liver cancer. He lives with the family of his brother Sh Tarsam Singh. His son Sh. Ravinder Thakur too has mouth cancer. Both of them were taken to Mumbai for the treatment and around ₹ 6 lac has been spent on treatment with no positive results. Now he (Mr. Santosh) is admitted in Navpreet Hosp, Putlighar,Amritsar. Unfortunately his grandson too was medically unfit and he had some problem in his brain. He was only 3 and after 2 years treatment unluckily he couldn’t be saved and he left for heavenly abode on 03 Dec 2017. They spent 8 to 10 lac on grandson also. Sh. Ravinder used to work in Trilliam Mall, Amritsar as team leader and he would earn around ₹ 10000 there but now since he is not working bcoz of his illness, the family is now penniless and borrowing money from relatives. whereas Sh. Santosh and his son earn only ₹ . 5000 and Tarsam's son Shiv earn Rs.12000 which definitely is very insufficient for the family of 9. ‘Let’s Help’ wants to offer help of around ₹ 4000 to 5000 every month to this family which can be in form of medicines, hospital expenses or any other requested area. Your suggestions for the above said case are solicited. Thnx

Harjit Singh (resident of , ₹ 2000 monthly rented House No. 322, New Shaheed Udam Singh Nagar, Gali number 3, Amritsar). is admitted in a SGRD hospital at walla in the ward of Dr. Manjeet Singh Uppal, with a stomach problem and waiting for some monetary help for the MRI and medical tests which doctors there have recommended. Her problem has not yet been diagnosed. She had been suffering from stomach problem since last 6 months. She has been admitted three times in Shri Guru Ram Dass hospital near Shaheedan under Dr. Navjot Brar’s supervision. They had to take loan of more than ₹ 1 lac for the same. Her husband used to earn ₹ 4000-5000 per month with carpentry but now from last many years he is having some neuro related problem because of which he often falls unconscious with foaming at mouth, so not working these days. A lot of money with no improvement of his health is spent on him too. Her son Mr. Honey (22 yr) works in shop at Tej Nagar where copper jewellery is made. He earns only ₹ 2500 per month. Earlier she used to do some tiny tasks and would earn ₹ 2000-3000 but now that earning too is at halt. Her married daughter and parental relatives are not financially sound enough to help them. Mobile no. of Ms. Arvinder's son is 6280223208. Let’s help wants to render help to them. Your valuable suggestions are solicited for the same.

14/02/18,- Rs.3500 spent for medical test and medicines for Ms. Arvinder Kaur (6280223208) As we had already informed you that patient was serious. . Ms. Arvinder Kaur expired.
14/02/18,- Dear all The above said case 👆 which was introduced a few days ago of Ms. Arvinder Kaur Who needed MRI test for her year old stomach problem, was given cash of ₹ 3500. Unfortunately the lady could not survive and expired even before the MRI could be conducted. In the meanwhile after she expired, we felt it very uncourteous to ask for the same from the grieved family, after all they had lost one of their family membeRs.Now after 9 days’ slice of time, when the concerned family was contacted, we got to know that they had burnt everything ( medicines, test reports, receipts, medical bills etc) in the pyre because of traditional last ritual practices. So no written record of the expenditure of ₹ 3500 could be presented. Hope you all understand. Thanx
